Exploit 1 -- 1-hiss.txt

For this exploit, one had to test to see how large BUFFER_SIZE is. To do this, one can keep entering characters
into the function, adding one each time until it seg faults. In this writing 24 characters, which would be 25
with the null character that gets added on, causes a seg fault. Therefore, after rsp + 24, there is a return 
address that you must rewrite. By disassembling hiss, one can find its address and use this in overwriting the
stack's initial return address to execute the hiss function.


Exploit 2

For this exploit, the exploit code specifies that one initilally has to move the chosen id number into rdi, 
argument 1's register, and then return this. Afterwards, one has to pad the rest of the buffer for its entire
size, which is 24 in this case. Afterwards, make the return address turn into the exploit code address to
execute this code. Finally, add the glow address to the stack as well to go there from the exploit code.
