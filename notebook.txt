Exploit 1 -- 1-hiss.txt

For this exploit, one had to test to see how large BUFFER_SIZE is. To do this, one can keep entering characters
into the function, adding one each time until it seg faults. In this writing 24 characters, which would be 25
with the null character that gets added on, causes a seg fault. Therefore, after rsp + 24, there is a return 
address that you must rewrite. By disassembling hiss, one can find its address and use this in overwriting the
stack's initial return address to execute the hiss function.
